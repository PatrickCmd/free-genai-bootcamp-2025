<core-grammar>
Here are 10 essential Jamaican Patois grammar rules for beginners:

1. No Gendered Nouns

Nouns have no gender
No need to memorize gender with nouns


2. No Article Agreement

Articles are simple and often reduced
Di (the), a (a/an)
No gender or number agreement


3. Adjective Placement

Adjectives usually come after the noun
Example: Dawg big (The dog is big)
No changes based on plural or singular


4. Subject Pronouns

Mi (I), Yu (You), Im (He/She)
Wi (We), Dem (They)
Subject pronouns are always used, no formal/informal distinction


5. Verb Conjugation

Verbs don’t change for person or number
Example: Mi guh, Yu guh, Dem guh (I go, You go, They go)
Tense is shown with particles (e.g., a, did, ago)


6. Negation

Use “nuh” before the verb
Example: Mi nuh nyam dat (I don’t eat that)


7. Question Formation

Use rising intonation for questions
Add “eh” or “no” at the end for yes/no questions
Example: Yu a guh? (Are you going?), Yu a guh, no? (You are going, right?)


8. Possession

Use “fi” to show possession
Example: Fi mi buk (My book), Fi yu cyaar (Your car)


9. No Verb-Subject Inversion

Questions don’t invert the verb and subject
Same structure as statements, just with question tone
Example: Yu si di man? (Did you see the man?)


10. Use of Particles

“A” for continuous actions (Mi a nyam – I am eating)
“Did” for past (Mi did guh – I went)
“Ago” for future (Mi ago guh – I will go)
