## Top 5 AI Deployment Patterns for Enterprises

According to the YouTube video "How Do Top Companies Deploy AI in 2025?", most enterprises utilize one of the following five patterns for deploying generative AI (gen AI) or AI applications in general.

### 1. API Integration

*   **Description:** AI applications are often developed as **microservices** that primarily interact through **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**.
*   These applications may reside within a **private virtual network** or have internet access to communicate with cloud-based large language models (LLMs) like those from OpenAI.
*   Communication typically occurs via **REST APIs**, involving components like **API Gateways** and access keys.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Strict access control** is crucial for determining who can access the AI application, including end-users and backend personnel.
    *   **Network security** measures should control access, potentially restricting traffic to known IP addresses.
    *   **API access keys** require protection for authentication when interacting with LLM models.
    *   Many enterprises host the backend of these applications internally within private virtual cloud networks due to security concerns.
    *   Continuous **monitoring for security misbehavior or anomalies** is essential.

### 2. Containerized Application

*   **Description:** This approach involves **packaging the entire AI application, including potentially an LLM model, into a container**.
*   This allows for local building and deployment in various environments.
*   Often used for **experimental purposes** with models from platforms like Hugging Face or DeepSeek on local machines.
*   Once validated, containerized components can be deployed within a **microservice architecture**.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   For local use on a laptop, security concerns are primarily limited to the device itself.
    *   For deployment in development or test environments, **identity and access management** becomes important.
    *   Careful consideration of the **data being used** is necessary, especially if the application might eventually be internet-facing.

### 3. Serverless Architecture

*   **Description:** Utilizes **serverless functions** (like AWS Lambda or cloud functions) to handle API requests for AI-enabled applications.
*   A **backend database**, potentially a vector database, stores data before and after processing.
*   Suitable for applications with significant data processing needs, though serverless can be challenging for such workloads.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Securing **API access keys** is vital.
    *   The **security of the database** itself needs to be ensured.
    *   Implementing **data security measures across the entire data lifecycle**, including transit, storage, and access control, is crucial, especially for batch data processing.

### 4. Private Endpoint with Cloud Service

*   **Description:** Leverages **private endpoints offered by cloud providers** (like AWS Bedrock) to host and experiment with LLM models without managing infrastructure.
*   A **private virtual network** may interact with these services.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Access control (identity)** remains a primary concern.
    *   The **type of data being sent and how it is managed** is critical, including encryption and the data lifecycle.

### 5. Hybrid Model

*   **Description:** Combines **on-premise resources (e.g., compute power, sensitive data)** with **cloud-based LLM services**.
*   Allows enterprises to utilize the best capabilities of both environments.
*   Many enterprise AI applications may fall into this category.
*   This foundational model can be combined with microservices or serverless architectures.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   The primary focus is on **network security**, controlling who has network access.
    *   Managing **data access** and ensuring only authorized data is allowed access is also key.
    *   **Identity and data security** are the two main security components in this model.

## Conclusion Summary Remark

In summary, top companies in 2025 are expected to deploy AI applications using a variety of patterns, ranging from API integrations for cloud-based LLMs to hybrid models leveraging both on-premise and cloud resources. Security is a consistent and critical consideration across all these deployment methods, with a strong emphasis on identity and access management, network security, and data protection throughout its lifecycle. The choice of deployment pattern often depends on factors such as the nature of the AI application, data sensitivity, cost considerations, and existing infrastructure.


## Top AI Risks

According to the YouTube video "The Top AI Risk & Most Common Implementation Patterns", the top risks associated with using generative AI (gen AI) applications include:

*   **Data Exposure and Privacy:** This is considered the **biggest risk** for organizations.
    *   Concerns arise about sharing sensitive data with LLMs, especially those with unclear privacy policies or potential geopolitical implications (e.g., DeepSeek and data sharing with China).
    *   The recommendation is to **keep sensitive data away from LLMs** and treat them as "dumb" tools by only sending instructions and receiving outputs without sharing extensive data.
*   **Model Misuse:** This risk is prevalent when using models that may not be as rigorously trained as leading models like ChatGPT or Claude.
    *   Using less sophisticated models, potentially downloaded from platforms like Hugging Face, can lead to **hallucinations and unexpected outputs**, potentially resulting in bad decision-making.
    *   Implementing **guardrails and continuously monitoring models** for vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior is crucial.
*   **Security, Compliance, and Regulatory Standards:** These are especially important for organizations handling **private data (PII)**.
    *   Organizations must understand and adhere to relevant compliance standards (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, ISO, SOC 2) when dealing with LLMs and data.
    *   Utilizing **cloud services with built-in compliance checks** (like Amazon Bedrock, Azure AI, or Google AI services) can help.
    *   Maintaining **audit logs** across the entire system is necessary for identifying and addressing issues.
    *   Certain regulations may require the **retention of data** related to LLM inputs and outputs.
*   **Legal Risk:** This encompasses **intellectual property (IP) and licensing risks**.
    *   Concerns exist regarding the use of **copyrighted material** for training LLM models, leading to lawsuits.
    *   Breaches of license can occur if the use of data or LLM services does not comply with their terms, including using data intended for non-commercial purposes commercially.

## Most Common Implementation Patterns

The YouTube video "The Top AI Risk & Most Common Implementation Patterns" highlights the following common deployment patterns for AI-enabled applications on public clouds:

*   **API Integration:** This involves using the **API capabilities of existing applications** (e.g., Gmail, Slack) to send requests to an LLM provider and receive outputs. This aligns with the **API integration** pattern described in the other source, where AI applications are created as microservices communicating through REST APIs.
*   **Private Endpoint:** Organizations may use a **private endpoint within their network** to interact with an external LLM provider or host a **private, locally hosted LLM** in their data center or cloud environment for enhanced privacy and compliance. This relates to the **Private Endpoint with Cloud Service** and aspects of the **Hybrid Model** discussed in the other source, where private virtual networks interact with cloud-hosted LLMs or where on-premise infrastructure hosts the LLM.
*   **Hybrid Models:** These involve combining on-premise resources with cloud-based LLM services. This is directly addressed as a key deployment pattern in the other source, often used when data is sensitive or significant on-premise compute resources exist.

The first source, "How Do Top Companies Deploy AI in 2025?", provides a more detailed breakdown of deployment patterns, which includes:

*   **Containerized Application:** Packaging AI applications into containers for local development and deployment.
*   **Serverless Architecture:** Utilizing cloud functions to handle API requests for AI applications.

While not explicitly mentioned as "most common" in the second source, these patterns are also relevant ways companies are deploying AI. The second source emphasizes that **API integration and private endpoints are very common** patterns currently observed.

From a technical risk perspective related to deployment:

*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Controlling who has access to the data provided to the LLM and the AI infrastructure is crucial.
*   **Encryption:** Ensuring data is encrypted and managing access to encryption keys is vital for data security.
*   **Network Security:** Configuring networks to prevent unauthorized external access and continuous monitoring for threats are essential.

## Conclusion Remark

In conclusion, the deployment of AI applications involves navigating significant risks, primarily concerning data privacy, model reliability, regulatory compliance, and intellectual property. Common implementation patterns such as API integrations, private endpoints, and hybrid models, often leveraging cloud services, are being adopted by companies. A strong focus on security measures, including robust identity management, encryption, and network protection, is paramount across all deployment strategies to mitigate these inherent risks.


Here is a summary of the top 2 AI security considerations to have in mind to avoid potential mistakes in 2025, based on the YouTube video "TOP 2 AI Security Mistakes to Avoid in 2025":

The video suggests that there are primarily **two key areas to consider for AI security**, and overlooking either of these could leave organizations vulnerable to attacks. These two areas can be thought of as perspectives on where to focus your security efforts:

1.  **Neglecting Runtime Security of AI Applications in Production:** If you already have AI applications running in production, your primary security concern should be **runtime security**. This involves ensuring the security of AI applications while they are actively operating. The video indicates that this is a distinct area of focus. Failing to adequately address the security of AI applications that are live and processing data would be a significant mistake.

2.  **Overlooking Security in the Pre-deployment Pipeline of AI-Capable Applications:** If you are deploying new applications with AI capabilities, your security focus should be on the **entire development and deployment pipeline**. This includes integrating security considerations from the initial stages of development through to deployment. This is particularly relevant for applications that make **API calls to external LLM models** (like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek) or applications that **natively use AI within them**. Understanding and addressing the **OS top 10 for LLM models** to secure these applications is crucial. A mistake would be to focus solely on traditional application security without considering the unique security challenges introduced by AI components and their integration.

In essence, the "mistakes to avoid" are failing to recognize and address the distinct security requirements of AI applications based on their lifecycle stage: either in runtime for existing applications or throughout the entire pipeline for new deployments.
