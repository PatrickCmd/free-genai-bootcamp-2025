# Hypothesis and Technical Uncertainty

## Hypothesis

The GenAI Architecting application aims to enhance language learning by integrating AI-powered tools and a robust database. The hypothesis is that by providing structured guidance through various study activities, students will engage more effectively with the language, leading to improved learning outcomes. The use of AI models like OpenAI's GPT-4o and Meta AI's Llama 3 70B is expected to facilitate personalized and interactive learning experiences.

## Technical Uncertainty

1. **AI Model Performance:**
   - The effectiveness of AI models in accurately processing and generating Jamaican Patois sentences is uncertain. The models must handle nuances in language structure and vocabulary effectively.

2. **Integration of Open-Source Models:**
   - Future plans to incorporate open-source models (e.g., Llama3.1 8B, Deepseek-R1) introduce uncertainty regarding their compatibility and performance compared to existing models.

3. **RAG Framework Efficiency:**
   - The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework's ability to enhance sentence construction through efficient retrieval and generation processes needs validation.

4. **User Engagement and Learning Outcomes:**
   - The extent to which the application can maintain user engagement and lead to measurable improvements in language proficiency remains to be tested.

5. **Scalability and Adaptability:**
   - Ensuring the application can scale to accommodate a growing number of users and adapt to different languages or dialects presents a technical challenge.

6. **Data Privacy and Security:**
   - Managing user data securely, especially when integrating with external AI models and databases, is a critical concern.

By addressing these uncertainties, the application aims to provide a reliable and effective platform for language learning, leveraging the latest advancements in AI technology.
