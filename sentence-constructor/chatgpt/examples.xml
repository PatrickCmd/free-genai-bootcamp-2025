    Cheatsheet:
    | Jamaican Patois | English       | Type   |
    |-----------------|---------------|--------|
    | bea             | bear          | Noun   |
    | doo             | door          | Noun   |
    | gabij           | garbage       | Noun   |
    | deh             | to be (location) | Verb (intransitive) |
    | lef             | to leave      | Verb (transitive)     |

    Sentence structure:
    [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

    Considerations:
    - This is a compound sentence with two parts connected by a comma.
    - The first part describes where something is located.
    - The second part asks about an action that happened in the past.
    - Patois often drops auxiliary verbs like “did” or “are” – you’ll need to figure out how to form the past tense using particles.
    - For "Bears are at the door," consider how Patois typically expresses presence at a location.
    - For "Did you leave the garbage out?" think of how to form a question in Patois using simple words for “leave” and “garbage.”

    Possible next steps:
    - attempt an answer using the vocabulary and structure provided
    - ask for clues about how to mark location in Patois
    - ask for clues on how to connect two sentences
    - ask for guidance on forming questions
    - ask for hints on expressing past actions
