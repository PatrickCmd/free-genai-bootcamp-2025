## Guide Example 1

To guide a student in translating an English sentence into Jamaican Patois, you can follow the structured approach outlined in the sentence-constructor/chatgpt/prompt.md file. Here's a step-by-step guide based on the instructions provided:
Step 1: Vocabulary Table
Create a vocabulary table that includes the necessary nouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives for the sentence. Ensure there are no repeats and provide the most common version of each word.
Step 2: Sentence Structure
Provide a possible sentence structure without including particles, tenses, or conjugations. Use simple sentence structures suitable for beginners.
Step 3: Clues and Considerations
Offer clues and considerations to help the student figure out the correct transcription. Avoid using Jamaican words directly; instead, refer to the vocabulary table. Provide examples of how to use the vocabulary and sentence structure.
Example
Let's say the student wants to translate the sentence: "Did you see the raven this morning? They were looking at our garden."

1. Vocabulary Table:

| Jamaican Patois | English |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Si | See |
| Raven | Raven |
| Mawnin | Morning |
| Dem | They |
| Luk | Look |
| Wi | Our |
| Gaadn | Garden |

2. Sentence Structure:
[Subject] [Object] [Verb]?
[Subject] [Verb] [Location].

3. Clues and Considerations:
Think about how to ask a question in Patois.
Consider the order of words in a question versus a statement.
Use the vocabulary table to find the Patois equivalents.
Remember that "this morning" can be a time indicator at the start or end of a sentence.
Example: "Yu si di raven dis mawnin?" (Did you see the raven this morning?)
Example: "Dem a luk pan wi gaadn." (They were looking at our garden.)
By following these steps, you can effectively guide the student in constructing sentences in Jamaican Patois while encouraging them to engage with the language actively.

## Guide Example 2

Certainly! Let's focus on providing clues that encourage the student to think critically about the translation without giving away the full sentences.
Step 1: Vocabulary Table
Create a vocabulary table with the necessary words for the sentence.
| Jamaican Patois | English |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Si | See |
| Raven | Raven |
| Mawnin | Morning |
| Dem | They |
| Luk | Look |
| Wi | Our |
| Gaadn | Garden |

Step 2: Sentence Structure
Provide a possible sentence structure without particles, tenses, or conjugations.
[Subject] [Object] [Verb]?
[Subject] [Verb] [Location].

Step 3: Clues and Considerations
Offer clues to help the student figure out the correct transcription:
Question Formation: Think about how questions are typically structured in Patois. The subject often comes first, followed by the object and verb.
Time Indicators: Consider where time indicators like "this morning" might fit in a sentence. They can be flexible in their placement.
Pronouns: Remember that "they" in Patois can be a single word that might not directly translate to English.
Action Description: For "looking at," think about how actions are described in Patois. The verb might be simpler than in English.
Possession: Consider how possession is shown in Patois. "Our" might be a single word that indicates belonging.
By using these clues, the student can work through the translation process, engaging more deeply with the language and its structure.

### **Vocabulary Table**

| Jamaican Patois | English       |
|-----------------|---------------|
| si              | see           |
| luk             | look          |
| ravin           | raven         |
| maanin          | morning       |
| wi               | our           |
| yaad            | garden/yard   |

### **Sentence Structure**

- [Subject] [Object] [Verb]? 
- [Time] [Subject] [Object] [Verb]. 
- [Subject] [Verb] [Location].

---

### **Clues and Considerations**

- For the question "Did you see the raven?" remember that Jamaican Patois often drops auxiliary verbs like "did." You'll need the verb for "see" and the word for "raven."
- "This morning" will go at the beginning for time. The Patois word for morning is in the table‚Äîthink about how to modify it for ‚Äúthis.‚Äù
- For the second sentence, "They were looking at our garden," keep in mind:
  - You'll need the verb for "look" from the table.
  - "Our" is given too, and "garden" often translates to a simpler word used commonly in Jamaica.
  - Jamaican Patois often uses "dem" for "they," but how would you show an action happening in the past? Think about simple particles you've seen in Patois sentences before.
- Remember, Jamaican Patois often has flexible sentence structures, but in this case, we‚Äôre keeping it simple.

**Example Usage:**
- "Yu si di ravin?" ‚Äì means "Did you see the raven?" Notice how there‚Äôs no ‚Äúdid‚Äù in the Patois version.
- "Dem a luk pan wi yaad." ‚Äì means "They are looking at our garden." But how would you express that it happened this morning?
